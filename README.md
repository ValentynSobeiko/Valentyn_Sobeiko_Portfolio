## üëã About Me

Experienced **Data & Analytics Engineer** with a demonstrated ability to design, build, and maintain scalable data solutions across cloud platforms. My work focuses on delivering robust data pipelines, modern analytics architecture, and high-impact reporting systems that support data-driven decision-making.

My experience spans both public and private sector environments ‚Äî from supporting financial policy research at the **European Parliament** to managing enterprise data workflows in a global analytics organization.

I specialize in:

- Developing **end-to-end ETL/ELT pipelines** using **Azure Data Factory**, **Databricks**, and **SQL**
- Implementing **Lakehouse** and **Medallion architecture** patterns in **Microsoft Fabric**
- Designing interactive dashboards and semantic models with **Power BI** and **DAX**
- Ensuring data quality and automation through **stored procedures**, **metadata tracking**, and **event-based orchestration**

I'm passionate about building efficient, transparent, and scalable data solutions that bridge technical implementation with real business value.
